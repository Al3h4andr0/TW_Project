Done all the CRUD calls for Locations. Add the TW.Postman_backend_calls.json in Postman like so:

- Upper-left-corner: You have "My workspace".
- Right next to it, you have an "import" button. Click on it.
- Click on "Link" on that bar
- Paste this link: https://www.getpostman.com/collections/3fcb655a2fbb2093493f
- Now in the upper left corner you have collections (with a folder icon). Click on it then you have a dropdown called TW_BACKEND
- All the examples for CRUD are there
